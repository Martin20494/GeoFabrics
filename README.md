# GeoFrabrics

The GeoFrabrics and associated sub-packages include routines and classes for combining point (i.e. LiDAR), vector (i.e. catchment of interest, infrastructure) and raster (i.e. reference DEM) to generate a hydrologically conditioned raster.

Scripts are included in separate repos. See https://github.com/rosepearson/Hydrologic-DEMs-scripts for an example.
